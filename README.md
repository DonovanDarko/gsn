Statement of Purpose:

This project aims to build a platform for gathering and parsing data for any risk youth that are participating in the EARRS program within the Generation Schools Network. 

# Goals:
- Gather and parse csv data for the purpose of tracking metrics that relate to a students success within the school system, i.e. record and track attendence rates and grade point average. 
- Facilitate the process of updating records for social workers who are having to contend with records from a variety of sources.
- Enable data to be uploaded from a variety of school networks into a remote database that can be accessed via a website
