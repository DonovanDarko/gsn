Statement of Purpose:

This project aims to build a platform for gathering and parsing data for any risk youth that are participating in the EARRS program within the Generation Schools Network. 

## Goals:
- Gather and parse csv data for the purpose of tracking metrics that relate to a students success within the school system, i.e. record and track attendence rates and grade point average. 
- Facilitate the process of updating records for social workers who are having to contend with records from a variety of sources.
- Enable data to be uploaded from a variety of school networks into a remote database that can be accessed via a website 

## Current Assumptions:
- Until further notice, any possible app will be hosted on Heroku. 

## Dangling Questions:
- Assuming we use SQL, where do we go from there? PostgreSQL? MySQL?
- What language jells best with the prospective group members? Node.js appears to be the current frontrunner.
- Will we use a framework? React? 

## Going Forward:
- Maintaining any initial momentum will likely hinge on good communication between team members and the partners at Generation Schools Network.
